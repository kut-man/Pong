## Code Description:

There are 3 files: Main, Play, Ball. "Main" creates "Welcome"-First Window and offers two option: One Player or Two
Player. After User choose his/her option, it calls "Play" File and this creates Play Window with two Rectangle and one
Line with Shape module. After, it calls to Ball class which is creates a circle.

I used AnimationTimer class to handle events because it seems simpler than TileLine class. I handled KeyRealised and
KeyPressed because Animation will smoother rather then resetting paddles everytime when user pressed button, it seems
rough and awkward.

Control Keys: "W", "S" : "P", "L"

That's all, I think you understood
all. [Here is full Code](https://github.com/Kutman7/Mid-Term-JavaFX/blob/main/sample/Main.java).
